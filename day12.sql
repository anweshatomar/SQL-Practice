Table: Contests

+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| contest_id   | int  |
| gold_medal   | int  |
| silver_medal | int  |
| bronze_medal | int  |
+--------------+------+
contest_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the LeetCode contest ID and the user IDs of the gold, silver, and bronze medalists.
It is guaranteed that any consecutive contests have consecutive IDs and that no ID is skipped.
 

Table: Users

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| mail        | varchar |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the users.
 

Write an SQL query to report the name and the mail of all interview candidates. A user is an interview candidate if at least one of these two conditions is true:

The user won any medal in three or more consecutive contests.
The user won the gold medal in three or more different contests (not necessarily consecutive).
Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Contests table:
+------------+------------+--------------+--------------+
| contest_id | gold_medal | silver_medal | bronze_medal |
+------------+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 190        | 1          | 5            | 2            |
| 191        | 2          | 3            | 5            |
| 192        | 5          | 2            | 3            |
| 193        | 1          | 3            | 5            |
| 194        | 4          | 5            | 2            |
| 195        | 4          | 2            | 1            |
| 196        | 1          | 5            | 2            |
+------------+------------+--------------+--------------+

Users table:
+---------+--------------------+-------+
| user_id | mail               | name  |
+---------+--------------------+-------+
| 1       | sarah@leetcode.com | Sarah |
| 2       | bob@leetcode.com   | Bob   |
| 3       | alice@leetcode.com | Alice |
| 4       | hercy@leetcode.com | Hercy |
| 5       | quarz@leetcode.com | Quarz |
+---------+--------------------+-------+

Result table:
+-------+--------------------+
| name  | mail               |
+-------+--------------------+
| Sarah | sarah@leetcode.com |
| Bob   | bob@leetcode.com   |
| Alice | alice@leetcode.com |
| Quarz | quarz@leetcode.com |
+-------+--------------------+

Sarah won 3 gold medals (190, 193, and 196), so we include her in the result table.
Bob won a medal in 3 consecutive contests (190, 191, and 192), so we include him in the result table.
    - Note that he also won a medal in 3 other consecutive contests (194, 195, and 196).
Alice won a medal in 3 consecutive contests (191, 192, and 193), so we include her in the result table.
Quarz won a medal in 5 consecutive contests (190, 191, 192, 193, and 194), so we include them in the result table.
 

Follow up:

What if the first condition changed to be "any medal in n or more consecutive contests"? How would you change your solution to get the interview candidates? Imagine that n is the parameter of a stored procedure.
Some users may not participate in every contest but still perform well in the ones they do. How would you change your solution to only consider contests where the user was a participant? Suppose the registered users for each contest are given in another table.

Solution:

with new_c as (
		select contest_id, gold_medal as medal from contests
		    union all
		select contest_id, silver_medal as medal from contests
		    union all
		select contest_id, bronze_medal as medal from contests
),

case1 as (
		select
		distinct c1.medal as id
		from new_c c1
		left join new_c c2 on c1.contest_id +1 = c2.contest_id
		left join new_c c3 on c1.contest_id +2 = c3.contest_id
		where c1.medal=c2.medal and c2.medal=c3.medal),

case2 as (
		select 
		gold_medal as id 
		from contests 
		group by gold_medal
		having count(contest_id)>=3
)

select
u.name,u.mail
from
(select id from case1 
 union 
 select id from case2) as t 
inner join users u on u.user_id = t.id
